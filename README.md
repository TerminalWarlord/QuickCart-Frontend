# QuickCart

QuickCart is a responsive online shopping application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The project is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with a modern and clean user interface.

# Design Reference

The design for QuickCart was based on a Figma file from the [Shopping E-commerce Website UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1321538390401626366/shopping-ecommerce-website-ui-kit-ui8). While the designs served as an excellent guide for the visual aspects of the project, please note the following:

- **PNG Format:** The design assets were provided in PNG format, not as interactive Figma components. This limited the ability to directly measure and implement precise spacing, padding, and other design details.
- **Measurement Accuracy:** Due to the lack of interactive elements, some measurements and alignments may not perfectly match the original design. Adjustments were made based on best estimates and practical application during the development process.

Despite these challenges, every effort was made to maintain the integrity and aesthetic of the original design while ensuring a functional and responsive user interface.
